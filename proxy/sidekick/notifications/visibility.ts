// Per-chat user-engagement signal — backs the visibility-aware push
// gate. The PWA POSTs visibility changes here so the proxy can
// distinguish "SSE attached but user isn't actively looking" from
// "user is foregrounded + viewing this chat right now".
//
// Why this exists in addition to hasActiveSubFor + the 30s idle gate
// (commit 529d8c4):
//
//   - SSE-attached is too loose: iOS Safari keeps SSE connections
//     alive for tens of seconds after the PWA backgrounds. With only
//     hasActiveSubFor as the gate, an agent reply that lands during
//     that window suppresses push and the user never sees the message.
//
//   - 30s idle is a coarse heuristic: a chat with deltas flowing every
//     second would never trigger it, even if the user just backgrounded
//     mid-reply.
//
// The visibility signal is the most direct + accurate: the PWA tells
// us, on every document.visibilitychange + every chat switch, what
// chat (if any) the user is actively viewing. The gate trusts the
// signal for a SHORT window (ENGAGED_WINDOW_MS = 2000ms, set 2026-05-12
// per Jonathan's responsiveness-bias: better push twice on a fast tab
// flick than miss a reply). Beyond the window, fall back to the
// existing hasActiveSubFor + idle gates.
//
// State is in-process only — no persistence. Subscriptions persist
// across proxy restart; visibility doesn't, and that's fine because
// the PWA re-reports on the next visibilitychange or chat switch.
