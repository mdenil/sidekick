// Persistent SSE channel: every outbound envelope from the hermes
// sidekick adapter is mirrored to subscribed PWA tabs, tagged with
// chat_id. The PWA opens this once on connect and keeps it open;
// turn lifecycle is decoupled from the connection lifecycle.
//
// GET /api/sidekick/stream
//
// Why a single persistent channel (replacing the per-message SSE):
//
//   - Hermes platform adapters can emit multiple `send()` calls per
//     turn (system bootstrap nudges, the actual agent reply, possibly
//     tool-result-as-text). The old per-POST SSE closed on the FIRST
//     reply_final, dropping every subsequent bubble. `reply_final`
//     means "this BUBBLE is done", NOT "the turn is done" — there
//     are no turn boundaries on the wire. This matches how
//     telegram/slack/signal adapters work.
//   - Notifications (cron output, /background results, scheduled
//     reminders) fire OUTSIDE any user-initiated turn and need a
//     persistent channel anyway.
//   - Cross-chat envelopes (notification for chat B while user is in
//     chat A, session_changed during compression) ride the same
//     channel; the PWA shell decides what to render where.
//
// Wire shape (one event per envelope):
//   event: <envelope.type>
//   data: <json envelope verbatim>
//
// Event types fanned out: reply_delta, reply_final, image, typing,
// notification, session_changed, error, tool_call, tool_result,
// user_message. All carry chat_id so the PWA can route to the right
// view. tool_call / tool_result are observational (Phase 3) — the PWA
// decides whether to render them based on the agentActivity setting.
// user_message is the cross-device broadcast for the user's own
// dispatched message (the originating device's optimistic bubble
// dedups against it).
//
// Replay ring: when no PWA tabs are subscribed, recent envelopes are
// held in a small ring so a tab opened seconds-after-fire still
// catches the message. Bounded at RECENT_CAP — the channel is
// user-visible state, not a durable bus, and a fresh install opening
// hours later shouldn't replay a backlog.
//
// Each entry carries a monotonic `id` so reconnecting subscribers
// (mobile-Safari background-kill, network handoff, etc.) can resume
// replay from a cursor via the SSE `Last-Event-ID` header — replay
// only entries with id > that cursor. Without the cursor a fresh
// subscriber gets the full ring (legacy behavior). When the missed
// window exceeds RECENT_CAP entries the client falls back to a
// transcript reconcile path; the ring is best-effort, not durable.
