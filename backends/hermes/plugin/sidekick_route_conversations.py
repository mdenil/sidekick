"""HTTP route handlers for /v1/conversations* (list, delete, rename).

Extracted from ``__init__.py`` 2026-05-17. Covers:

  - ``GET /v1/conversations``               channel-only drawer
  - ``GET /v1/gateway/conversations``       cross-platform drawer
  - ``DELETE /v1/conversations/{id}``       cascade delete
  - ``PATCH /v1/conversations/{id}``        rename (sets sessions.title)
  - ``_summaries_by_user_id(...)``          state.db aggregation
  - ``delete_conversation_sync(...)``       worker-thread cascade
  - ``rename_conversation_sync(...)``       worker-thread title update
  - ``_purge_hindsight_for_session_uuids``  memory-store cleanup

Wiring contract: every public coroutine takes the calling
``SidekickAdapter`` instance + the aiohttp request. The mutation
handlers reach into ``adapter._state_db_path``,
``adapter._session_state_cache``, ``adapter._sid_to_chat_id_cache``,
and the envelope publishers (``_safe_send_envelope`` on the
adapter, and ``sidekick_route_events.publish_out_of_turn`` for the
out-of-turn channel).

    """Drawer aggregation grouped by ``(user_id, source)``.

    Returns ``[(chat_id, source, chat_type, title, message_count,
    turn_count, tool_count, last_active_at, created_at,
    first_user_message), …]`` sorted most-recently-active first,
    bounded by ``limit``.

    ``turn_count`` is user-role messages (the user's mental model of
    "how many times have I said something"); ``tool_count`` is the
    opaque count of tool-call/result rows hermes inserted along the
    way. The drawer renders ``N turns · M tools`` when both are
    present (vs the misleading ``message_count`` which used to read
    as e.g. "39 msgs" when the user had only spoken twice and the
    agent had run 35 tool calls under the hood).

    ``sources`` is the platform allow-list — any non-empty
    ``sessions.source`` is included if its value is in this tuple.
    Pass ``("sidekick",)`` for the channel-only drawer; pass the
    full set (sidekick, telegram, slack, whatsapp, …) for the
    cross-platform gateway drawer.

    chat_type is fixed to "dm" because state.db doesn't carry it
    explicitly. The plugin's existing surface only exposed DM
    chats; group/channel inference would need an out-of-band
    signal (room id parsing) which lives in the platform adapters,
    not here.

    ``parent_session_id`` chains (compression forks) are walked
    via a recursive CTE that maps every session to its root
    user_id. The upstream hermes contract claims rotated sessions
    inherit user_id from the root, but in practice compaction
    creates child sessions with user_id=NULL (Jonathan field bug
    2026-05-12). The CTE resolves the effective user_id by walking
    parent_session_id chains until we hit a session with user_id
    set; that root user_id is then used as the GROUP BY key for
    the drawer row.

    Where ORDER BY matters: ``ORDER BY started_at DESC LIMIT 1`` for
    the title pulls the *latest* session for the chat (whatever
    compression and session_reset did), which is what the drawer
    wants.
