"""HTTP route handler for ``POST /v1/sidekick/upload`` — large-file staging.

Task #158. Big PDFs (Jonathan hit a 57 MB file) can't ride the
base64-in-JSON ``attachments`` field on ``/v1/responses``: base64
inflates ~33% and the whole body buffers in memory, blowing the 50 MB
proxy + aiohttp body limits. This route accepts the RAW file bytes
(no base64, streamed straight to disk) and returns an ``upload_id``.

The PWA then sends its normal turn on ``/v1/responses`` with the
attachment carrying ``{type, mimeType, fileName, uploadId}`` instead of
inline ``content``. ``_materialize_attachments`` resolves the
``uploadId`` back to the staged file (see its ``upload_id`` branch).

Stateless by design: the staged path is derived deterministically from
the ``upload_id`` (a hex token), so a plugin restart between upload and
send doesn't orphan the reference — the file is still on disk and the
path is reconstructable. ``upload_id`` is validated as a 32-char hex
token before any filesystem touch, so it can't escape the staging dir.

Small files (≤ the client's upload threshold) keep the existing
base64-in-JSON path; only large attachments come through here.
