"""Sidekick platform adapter for hermes-agent.

Runs an aiohttp HTTP server bound to localhost that speaks the abstract
agent contract (OpenAI-Responses-shaped). The sidekick proxy (Node.js)
talks to it via /v1/* endpoints; the agent contract is documented at
``docs/ABSTRACT_AGENT_PROTOCOL.md`` in the sidekick repo.

Sidekick is a peer of telegram / slack / signal — the hermes gateway
owns the chat_id → session_id mapping natively.

HTTP surface
------------
All routes auth-gate on ``Authorization: Bearer <token>`` where
``<token>`` is read from env var ``SIDEKICK_PLATFORM_TOKEN`` at adapter
startup.

Channel contract (the OAI-compat surface)::

    GET    /health
    GET    /v1/conversations              # drawer list (sidekick rows)
    GET    /v1/conversations/{id}/items   # transcript replay
    DELETE /v1/conversations/{id}         # cascade delete
    PATCH  /v1/conversations/{id}         # rename (sets sessions.title)
    POST   /v1/responses                  # turn dispatch (SSE on stream:true)
    GET    /v1/events                     # out-of-turn SSE

Gateway extension (sidekick-defined, optional)::

    GET    /v1/gateway/conversations      # cross-platform drawer list

The proxy probes ``/v1/gateway/conversations`` first; on 404 it falls
back to the channel surface and stamps source='sidekick'. Hermes
implements the gateway endpoint because hermes IS a gateway —
telegram, slack, whatsapp etc. live behind the same state.db.

Inbound dispatch goes through ``/v1/responses`` which calls
``self.handle_message(MessageEvent(...))``. The gateway resolves the
session via the standard
``build_session_key(SessionSource(platform=Platform.SIDEKICK, chat_id=...))``
DM path — ``agent:main:sidekick:dm:<chat_id>``.

Outbound envelope shapes (see SidekickEnvelope in
``server-lib/backends/hermes-gateway/upstream.ts``)::

    {"type": "reply_delta",     "chat_id": "...", "text": "<accumulated>",
     "message_id": "..."}
    {"type": "reply_final",     "chat_id": "...", "message_id": "..."}
    {"type": "image",           "chat_id": "...", "url": "...", "caption": "..."}
    {"type": "typing",          "chat_id": "..."}
    {"type": "notification",    "chat_id": "...", "kind": "cron", "content": "..."}
    {"type": "session_changed", "chat_id": "...", "session_id": "...",
     "title": "..."}
    {"type": "tool_call" / "tool_result" / "error", ...}

In-turn envelopes ride the ``/v1/responses`` SSE stream as OAI events
(translated by the proxy back to the sidekick envelope shape). All
others ride ``/v1/events`` with a Last-Event-ID replay ring.

``session_changed`` is detected via state.db polling
(``_session_poll_loop``) — no hermes core patches required for it.
Trade-off: ~1.5s lag between compression and the PWA seeing the new
title.

PDF rasterization
-----------------
Sidekick PWA uploads of ``application/pdf`` are rasterized to per-page
PNGs in ``_materialize_attachments`` via ``_rasterize_pdf`` (which
shells out to ``pdftoppm`` from poppler-utils). The PDF tempfile is
unlinked after rasterization; the agent only sees images via the
existing ``media_urls`` → vision-tool pipeline. This is sidekick-only
scope — telegram / slack / whatsapp / signal each have separate
attachment flows in ``gateway/platforms/*.py`` and don't share this
materializer (yet).

System dep: ``apt install poppler-utils`` on Debian/Ubuntu, or
``brew install poppler`` on macOS. Without it PDFs are dropped and a
clear error is logged at the first PDF upload attempt.

Knobs (env, with defaults sized for a Pi 5 host):
``SIDEKICK_PDF_DPI`` (150), ``SIDEKICK_PDF_MAX_PAGES`` (50),
``SIDEKICK_PDF_RASTERIZE_TIMEOUT_S`` (30),
``SIDEKICK_PDF_MAX_BYTES`` (20 MiB).

See ``docs/archive/PDF_RASTERIZATION_PROPOSAL.md`` in the sidekick
repo for design notes.

Install
-------
This adapter requires a hermes patch that registers
``Platform.SIDEKICK`` and the adapter-factory branch. See
``0001-add-sidekick-platform.patch`` and ``README.md`` next to this file.

Plugin shape note
-----------------
This file is *also* importable as a hermes plugin module via a tiny
``register(ctx)`` function. The hermes plugin system does NOT have a
``register_platform_adapter`` extension point (yet), so the plugin
``register()`` here is a no-op — the adapter is wired in via the
``_create_adapter()`` factory branch added by the patch. The plugin
manifest exists so ``hermes plugins list`` shows it.

# itself is never handed to the agent — vision tools don't consume PDFs.
#
# Tunable via env at adapter startup. Defaults chosen for a Pi 5 host:
#  * 150 DPI keeps PNGs readable for body text without ballooning bytes.
#  * 50-page cap avoids 100-page-deck wedge times (50 pages ≈ 10s).

# or (c) polling from the PWA on tab-focus — the adapter already runs
# in-process with the gateway, so it has direct read access to state.db
# and zero additional moving parts.
#
# Trade-off accepted: ~1s lag between compression and the PWA seeing a
# title refresh. Polling cost is one indexed SELECT per cadence tick;
# negligible at sidekick's single-user scale.
#
# Cadence: every 1.5s while a proxy client is connected. Skipped when

        Why this lives in the sidekick plugin (and not in hermes core):
        sidekick is the only platform that rasterizes PDFs to N image
        pages — every other adapter (telegram, signal, slack, ...) sees
        at most a handful of attached images per turn. The gateway's
        ``_enrich_message_with_vision`` (gateway/run.py) iterates
        ``image_paths`` SERIALLY by design — fine for 1-3 images, brutal
        for a 21-page PDF (21 × ~5s = ~100s before the primary model
        sees any text). Parallelizing in the plugin keeps the win where
        the cost actually lands without forcing a hermes-core change.

        Strategy: split image entries off ``media_urls``, run
        ``vision_analyze_tool`` in parallel via ``asyncio.gather``, and
        prepend the descriptions to ``text`` using the SAME format the
        gateway's enrich loop produces — so agent behavior is identical
        (the path-embedded follow-up hint lets the agent re-call
        ``vision_analyze`` for a closer look at any specific page).

        Non-image media (audio, video) is left in ``media_urls`` for the
        gateway to handle through its own enrichers — those run once per
        attachment and aren't a multi-page bottleneck.

        The PWA sends each attachment as
        ``{type, mimeType, fileName, content}`` where ``content`` is a
        full ``data:<mime>;base64,<payload>`` string. Hermes wants
        on-disk paths in ``MessageEvent.media_urls`` (telegram adapter
        models this — it downloads photos to a cache dir, then sets
        media_urls to those paths). We mirror that contract for the
        sidekick path: write to ``/tmp/sidekick-attach-<uuid>.<ext>``
        and let the OS clean tmpdirs on its own schedule (sidekick is
        single-user, single-host; a stray /tmp file is harmless).

        PDF attachments are rasterized server-side before they reach
        the agent: ``application/pdf`` payloads get written to a temp
        ``.pdf``, then ``_rasterize_pdf`` shells out to ``pdftoppm`` and
        replaces the PDF entry with one ``image/png`` entry per page.
        Vision-capable models (gemma-3, claude, gpt-4o, gemini) consume
        images natively, not PDFs — this keeps the existing media_urls
        → vision-tool pipeline doing all the work without each model
        backend needing to know about PDFs. The PDF tempfile itself is
        deleted as soon as rasterization completes; only the PNG pages
        are returned (and tracked for end-of-turn cleanup).

        Sidekick-only scope: telegram/whatsapp/slack/signal each have
        their own platform adapters with separate attachment flows

        Why role='assistant' and not a custom role: this IS the agent's
        reply — it just got routed through the cron scheduler instead
        of a /v1/responses turn. Persisting under role='assistant' in
        the user's chat session means:
          (a) reload finds the row via the same items endpoint the rest
              of the transcript uses (single source of truth — same as
              Telegram, which echoes platform-delivered messages back
              into state.db via webhook),
          (b) hermes' context loader pulls it into the next turn's
              prompt (which is correct — the agent SHOULD know what
              cron output it produced when forming the next reply),
          (c) one query at fetch time, no UNION.

        The PWA discriminates notification rows from regular replies
        via the `kind` field on the wire item (set from
        sidekick_msg_links.kind). Renderer paints them as
        .line.system.notification regardless of state.db role.
