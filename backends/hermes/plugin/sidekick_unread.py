"""Unread compute against hermes state.db.

Mirrors openclaw plugin's ``src/unread-storage.js``: derive per-chat
unread count by walking state.db for assistant rows newer than the
``unread_state.last_read_at`` pointer. Same SSOT model: this count
drives sidebar badges, app badge (sum), and was the implicit input
to push dispatch.

Reads from hermes state.db via a read-only sqlite connection. The
plugin's ``_state_db_path`` field carries the resolved location.

    ``{chats: [{chat_id, unread_count, marked_unread, last_read_at}],
       total: N}``.

    ``total`` is the SUM of per-chat counts (Jonathan picked the sum
    over a chat-count aggregate for higher-fidelity feedback).

    Counts assistant rows (tool-call orchestrators excluded) with
    timestamp > last_read_at, from TWO sources:
      * state.db ``messages`` — canonical post-turn-flush body store
      * sidekick.db ``msg_links`` unlinked entries — envelope-time
        writes that haven't been flushed to state.db yet

    The union is essential because hermes flushes state.db only at
    end-of-turn. A short "Checking." reply lands in msg_links seconds
    before its state.db twin; counting state.db only made the unread
    count return 0 for that brief window → PWA badge.ts:109's
    auto-markAllRead nuked the activity row as "stale" (Jonathan field
    bug 2026-05-29: agent's quick-ack reply got no badge while the
    full reply minutes later badged correctly).

    For sticky ``marked_unread=1``, returns at least 1 regardless of
    the timestamp comparison.
