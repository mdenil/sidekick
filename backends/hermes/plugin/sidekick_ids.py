"""Shared ID-encoding helpers for the hermes-side sidekick plugin.

Extracted from ``__init__.py`` 2026-05-17 so route-handler submodules
(``sidekick_route_*``) can import the same encoding logic without a
circular dep on the package init. ``__init__.py`` re-exports these
symbols for backward compat with any code that still references them
from the package root.

Don't add stateful objects here — this module is import-cheap on
purpose. Functions only, plus the source-name constants.

# ── Gateway id encoding ─────────────────────────────────────────────
# The agent contract guarantees ``ConversationSummary.id`` is globally
# unique. Hermes natively keys sessions by ``(source, user_id)`` —
# ``user_id`` IS the platform chat_id, and the same chat_id can recur
# across sources (e.g. a sidekick test session that happens to use a
# WhatsApp ``@lid`` as its chat_id, or a telegram numeric id that
# coincides with a sidekick UUID). Exposing user_id alone as ``id``
# violates uniqueness; the drawer then renders two LIs with the same
# ``data-chat-id``, click activates both, and history fetches go
# through ``_resolve_source_for_chat_id`` which picks one source
# arbitrarily — wrong session content appears in the right row.
#
# Encode ``(source, chat_id)`` into a single contract-unique id:
#   ``${source}:${chat_id}``  e.g. ``whatsapp:199999999999999@lid``
#
# Sources are internal constants (no colons); chat_ids in the wild
# don't contain colons in any platform we support. We split on FIRST
# ``:`` — chat_ids containing colons would still round-trip correctly.
# Frontend treats ``id`` as opaque. Per-chat URLs (``/v1/conversations/
# {id}/items``, DELETE) decode the prefix server-side to disambiguate.
#
# Backward compat: if an ``id`` arrives at the per-chat handler WITHOUT
# a prefix, fall through to ``_resolve_source_for_chat_id`` so legacy
# callers (channel-only ``/v1/conversations`` consumers, ad-hoc curls)
# keep working. New callers should always use prefixed ids.
