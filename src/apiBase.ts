/**
 * @fileoverview Resolves the origin that server API calls target.
 *
 * Historically the app was always served from the same origin as its API
 * (https://<host>:3001), so every call used a relative URL or
 * location.origin. To let the Capacitor iOS shell serve the app's ASSETS
 * locally (capacitor://localhost) for a native-fast cold boot while still
 * reaching the remote agent, server calls must point at an explicit origin
 * instead of "wherever the page was loaded from".
 *
 * The split that matters:
 *   - ASSETS (/build, /styles, /assets, icons, /manifest.json) stay RELATIVE
 *     — in the CAP shell they're bundled and served locally.
 *   - SERVER endpoints (/api, /config, /tts, /transcribe) flow through
 *     apiUrl() / apiOrigin() so they hit the remote host.
 *
 * In a browser PWA / desktop the page scheme is http(s): apiOrigin() returns
 * location.origin and behavior is byte-identical to before. Inside the CAP
 * local-asset shell the page scheme is capacitor: (or file:), so we read the
 * remote host the config flow saved in localStorage under SERVER_URL_KEY
 * (the same key the legacy bootstrap used).
