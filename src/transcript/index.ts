/**
 * @fileoverview Crack A — transcript pipeline bootstrap.
 *
 * Wires the store → projection → reconciler chain to the live
 * transcript element. Called once from main.ts boot. After this,
 * every mutation through the store (setDurable, appendInflight,
 * addPendingSend, …) automatically re-renders the active chat.
 *
 * Background-chat events still mutate the store but the reconciler
 * skips them — they re-render on the next session switch.
