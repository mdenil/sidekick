/**
 * @fileoverview Session lifecycle ops shared between sessionDrawer + proxyClient.
 *
 * Consolidates the cross-module state that needs to agree when a session
 * is deleted, and gives both modules ONE source of truth for "is this id
 * a phantom we just deleted in this tab?"
 *
 * Why this lives here, not in sessionDrawer:
 *   - sessionDrawer owns drawer-render state (cachedSessions, the
 *     switchController focus epoch, etc.). It only needs to know "is this id
 *     deleted?" to filter the visible list.
 *   - proxyClient owns server-side lifecycle (activeChatId, conversations
 *     IDB row, sessions endpoint). It needs the same answer to bail out
 *     of `resumeSession` before its own `setActive(id)` re-pins a chat
 *     that was just deleted.
 *   - Putting `recentlyDeleted` on either module forces an awkward import.
 *     A neutral module both can consult is the natural shape.
 *
 * The set is in-memory + scoped to the current tab. A page reload clears
 * it (which is fine — the underlying server-side delete already happened,
 * and the drawer rebuilds from the server's listSessions which won't
 * include the deleted id). Cross-tab signaling isn't needed; each tab
 * tracks its own in-flight click-then-delete races.
