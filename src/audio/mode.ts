/**
 * @fileoverview AudioMode interface — the dispatch contract that both
 * voice modes (turn-based and realtime) implement. Lets `src/main.ts`
 * pick a mode based on `settings.realtime` and call into it without
 * mode-specific branching.
 *
 * See `src/audio/README.md` for the full picture (where each mode
 * lives, what's shared, what's mode-specific). This file is just the
 * contract.
 *
 * The interface is richer than a bare lifecycle (start/stop/isActive)
 * because today both modes drive the same agent-contract endpoints
 * (`/api/sidekick/messages` + `/api/sidekick/stream`), so "user
 * committed an utterance" and "agent reply playing" are meaningful in
 * both. A future duplex-native backend (OpenAI Realtime, Gemini Live)
 * would break that: realtime mode would stream audio in both
 * directions without discrete commit boundaries, so `onCommit` would
 * stop being meaningful for that mode. When that lands we'll either
 * widen `AudioModeState` (add `speaking` / `listening` / `interrupted`)
 * or split this interface into `AudioMode` + `DuplexMode`. Don't
 * pre-build the abstraction — the duplex shape isn't pinned down.
 */
