/**
 * @fileoverview Listen — turn-based handsfree mic mode. Two body-
 * transcription paths, gated by the `streamingEngine` setting:
 *
 *   - SERVER (`streamingEngine: 'server'`, the default) — record locally
 *     with MediaRecorder, run Web Speech API for sendword detection in
 *     parallel, and on commit ship the FULL buffered blob to
 *     /v1/transcribe (via /transcribe). Caller's `onCommit(blob, reason)`
 *     fires.
 *
 *   - LOCAL (`streamingEngine: 'local'`) — no blob, no /transcribe.
 *     Open a `BrowserSttProvider` (Web Speech API) and accumulate its
 *     transcript events into the turn's body text. Sendword detector
 *     subscribes to the SAME provider via the new external-source API
 *     so we run a single SR session per turn instead of two racing for
 *     the mic. On commit, caller's `onCommitText(text, reason)` fires.
 *
 * Reply renders + plays through the existing playReplyTts path
 * (caller-owned). After audio.ended + a small grace window, re-arms for
 * the next turn.
 *
 * Listen is wiring on top of existing primitives, NOT a new pipeline.
 * WebRTC (talk + stream) stays untouched — Listen lives alongside.
 *
 * State machine:
 *   idle       — start() not yet called or stop() returned.
 *   armed      — recording (server) or live-transcribing (local),
 *                watching for silence + sendword.
 *   committing — silence/sendword fired; awaiting onCommit/onCommitText.
 *   playing    — caller invoked notifyReplyPlayback(true); waiting
 *                for notifyReplyPlayback(false) → grace → re-arm.
 *
 * Disarm: mic-button tap or menu-toggle off, both wired through stop().
 *
 * Test hooks: when ?listen_mock_mic=1 is set on the URL, the module
 * exposes window.__listen.{state, injectSilence, injectSpeech} so the
 * Playwright smoke can drive synthetic frames into the silence detector
 * without a real getUserMedia stream.
