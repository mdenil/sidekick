/**
 * @fileoverview HTTP TTS playback for text-typed agent replies.
 *
 * Wired from `main.ts:handleReplyFinal` whenever `settings.tts` is on AND
 * a WebRTC call is NOT in progress (call mode owns audio end-to-end via
 * its own peer-track TTS). Fetches Deepgram Aura via the server's
 * `/tts` proxy and plays the returned mp3 through the shared `#player`
 * audio element. Cancellation is "last reply wins" — a fresh
 * `playReplyTts()` cancels any in-flight playback before starting.
 *
 * iOS gesture binding: the playback path needs a primed AudioContext to
 * actually emit sound on Mobile Safari. The send button handler already
 * touches mic/audio (via memo / dictate / call paths), and the global
 * pointerdown/keydown unlock at boot covers all other entry points.
 *
 * Text cleaning: re-implements the regex set from
 * `test/tts-clean.test.ts` (whose `cleanForTts` was once exported from
 * `src/pipelines/classic/tts.ts` — file is gone, regex set lives on in
 * the test as the canonical reference). Keep these in sync.
 *
 * Event emitter: classic ported pattern. Public events carry replyId in
 * payload so the per-bubble UX (replyPlayer.ts) can route updates by
 * bubble identity instead of relying on a shared global. Critical for
 * keeping the bubble's loading bar / playhead / glyph swap honest under
 * cancel/replay/skip operations. Subscribers register via on() and
 * unsubscribe via off(); call once at boot.

 *    - speechSynthesis.cancel() is required as the FIRST line of
 *      every fresh speak — iOS Safari's queue isn't auto-cleared on
 *      a new utterance and old ones can stall the new one indefinitely.
 *    - The voice list (speechSynthesis.getVoices) often arrives
 *      asynchronously after `voiceschanged` fires. settings.ts already
 *      handles this for the picker; here we accept whatever's loaded
 *      at speak time and fall back to system default if the chosen
 *      voice has been GC'd.
 *    - Some iOS versions silently drop utterances ≥ ~32k chars; cleaned
