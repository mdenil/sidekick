/**
 * @fileoverview Shared handsfree-commit policy used by both audio modes.
 *
 * Both modes need to answer the same question: "is this user utterance
 * done?" Two triggers, identical semantics in both modes:
 *
 *   1. Sendword — utterance ends in a configured phrase (default "over").
 *      The phrase is stripped and what's left dispatches.
 *   2. Silence timeout — N seconds without detected speech ends the
 *      utterance.
 *
 * This module owns the *policy* (regex shape, threshold reading) only.
 * The *mechanism* for detecting speech stays per-mode — turn-based
 * runs an analyser-frame peak loop on the local mic; realtime gets
 * discrete `is_final` text events from the bridge. Different inputs,
 * same policy.
 *
 * See `src/audio/README.md` "Handsfree mechanisms (shared)".

 *  end-anchored with optional trailing punctuation, case-insensitive.
