/**
 * @fileoverview Single owner of the session-switch epoch.
 *
 * Session focus used to live in three loosely-coupled globals inside
 * sessionDrawer (optimisticActiveId, viewedSessionId, resumeGen), read
 * with inconsistent precedence at ~15 sites — and only resumeGen carried
 * any epoch protection, scoped to resume()'s own body. The result was a
 * split-brain: the drawer highlight (painted by refresh() off a stale
 * pre-await snapshot) and the transcript (gated by a lagging viewed id)
 * could disagree, producing the A→B→A highlight bounce on slow links.
 *
 * This module makes "which switch is current" a single source of truth.
 * A switch mints one token via begin(); EVERY async continuation that
 * wants to write focus, highlight, or transcript checks isCurrent(tok)
 * (or routes through ifStillFocused) and no-ops when superseded. Only the
 * latest switch can write.
 *
 * State machine:
 *   - `optimistic` — the row to highlight while a switch is in flight.
 *     Set synchronously at click/begin so refresh() paints the clicked
 *     row even before the transcript fetch resolves.
 *   - `viewed` — the session whose transcript is COMMITTED on screen.
 *     Promoted from optimistic on the first render (cache or, for a cold
 *     chat, server) via commit(). This is what the live-delta / SSE /
 *     engagement gates read.
 *   - `gen` — monotonic generation. begin() bumps it; a token is "current"
 *     iff its gen still equals the live gen.
 *
 * The token carries an optional targetMessageId (the pin/activity drill
 * anchor) so a future range-aware cache can resolve "which cached window
 * to paint for this switch" without a side channel — the controller owns
 * WHAT we're switching to (session + anchor); sessionCache owns the best
 * cached range for that target.
 *
 * Pure leaf module: no app imports, so it stays trivially testable and
 * cycle-free. The side effects of "a view changed" (badge clear, activity
 * read-marking, reportChatSwitch, highlight clear) stay in
 * sessionDrawer.setViewed — this module only owns the identity + epoch.
