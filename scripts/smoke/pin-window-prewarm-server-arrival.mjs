// #243 follow-up — pin around-window prewarm when pins arrive FROM THE
// SERVER after boot (fresh CAP install path).
//
// Field report (CAP, 2026-06-15): on a FRESH rebuild the user opened the
// app, let it sit OPEN 30+s on good wifi, then clicked a pin — and that
// click triggered the around-window load for ALL pins right then, instead
// of them already being warm. So the boot prewarm warmed nothing and the
// later server-driven pin arrival never re-kicked it.
//
// Why the sibling smoke (pin-window-prewarm.mjs) didn't catch this: it
// seeds the pin server-side BEFORE boot, so the boot refreshFromServer GET
// returns it and the boot-time `sidekick:pins-changed` path covers it. The
// fresh-install reality is different: localStorage is EMPTY at boot (boot
// prewarm sees listAllPins()==[] and warms nothing), and the pins land
// LATER via the cross-device server-reconcile path:
//   proxyClient `pins_changed` stream envelope
//     → window `sidekick:server-pins-changed`
//     → ServerBackedStore requestRefresh() (debounced) → refreshFromServer()
//
// This scenario reproduces exactly that: NO pin is seeded at boot. After
// the app is ready, a pin is seeded server-side (mock.seedPin) and the
// cross-device envelope is simulated by dispatching the same
// `sidekick:server-pins-changed` event proxyClient would. The prewarm must
// then warm the pin's around-window with NO manual drill.
//
// Discriminator (no drill anywhere): after the post-boot server pin lands,
// drillWindowCache.getWindow(chatId, msgId) must return a populated window
// purely from the background prewarm. Pre-fix (prewarm only listens on
// `sidekick:pins-changed`) the window can stay empty until a manual drill,
// so getWindow returns null and the assertion fails. Post-fix (prewarm
// also listens on `sidekick:server-pins-changed`) the prewarm fills it.
