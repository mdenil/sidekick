// Bug B (field 2026-06-14, desktop): the agent's full reply lands after
// the tool calls and renders in the chat. The user switches away to a
// different chat and back — and the just-arrived reply is GONE for
// 10-15s before it reappears.
//
// ROOT CAUSE (proven by this repro): when a reply_final lands while the
// chat is viewed, schedulePostFinalDurableRefresh (backendEventHandlers.ts)
// fetches the freshly-mirrored server rows and PROMOTES the reply from the
// inflight buffer into the in-memory durable store, then clears the inflight
// reply_final (its only backup). But that path does NOT refresh the
// structured messages cache (sessionCache) — only loadEarlier/loadLater/
// drill write it. So the messages cache still holds the PRE-reply rows.
// On switch-back, sessionDrawer.resume paints CACHE-FIRST from that stale
// cache: setDurable(stale) clobbers the in-memory durable that held the
// reply, and the inflight backup is already gone. The reply vanishes until
// the (slow) server reconcile lands — exactly the 10-15s gap.
//
// This smoke stalls the switch-back server reconcile so the cache-paint
// window is observable, and asserts the reply is STILL on screen during
// that window. Failing-first on current code (reply absent during the
// stall); passes once the post-final promotion writes through to the cache.
