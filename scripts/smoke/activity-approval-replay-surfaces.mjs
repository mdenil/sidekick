// Regression: an approval that the user never actioned (inline buttons
// never tapped) must still be RECOVERABLE in the Activity tray.
//
// Real-world trigger: the approval arrives as a Web Push while the app
// is closed. The user doesn't tap the inline approve/deny button. When
// they next open the app, the server replays the approval envelope with
// `_replay: true`. Before this fix, handleNotification's `if (!replay)`
// guard skipped `upsertNotification` for ALL replayed envelopes — so the
// replayed approval was NEVER projected into the activity store, and
// since the smoke/offline path has no server-side activity record to
// hydrate from, the approval vanished from the tray entirely. The user
// had to run /approve manually.
//
// Contract pinned here: a replayed approval (delivered ONLY as a replay,
// never live) still appears as an Activity item the user can find and
// act on later. We deliberately suppress the banner/badge-bump on replay
// (no re-alert spam on every reconnect) but the tray row must exist.
