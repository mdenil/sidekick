// Residual #225 / #239 (field 2026-06-14): a plain reload yanked the user
// to the most-recently-active chat — the busy agent thread — instead of the
// chat they were on.
//
// The #225 fix made the viewed session id survive the reload (localStorage,
// read at boot as restoredSid). But boot only LANDS on restoredSid when its
// resume returns messages: `if (messages.length) { ...; bootRendered = true }`.
// If that resume comes back EMPTY or ERRORED (cold radio at launch, a chat
// you just opened that's still empty, a transient server hiccup),
// bootRendered stays false and the fall-through picks sessions[0] — the
// most-recently-active chat. That's the #225-class spurious switch: a reload
// drops you into whatever chat the agent was last busy in.
//
// FIX (main.ts boot fall-through): when the chosen landing target
// (urlChatId / restoredSid / pinnedTop — a DELIBERATE target, not the bare
// adapter default) still EXISTS in the session list, land on IT even if its
// resume was empty, instead of jumping to most-recent. Only fall to
// most-recent when the deliberate target is gone (deleted) or there was no
// deliberate target at all (genuine fresh install with existing history).
//
// Repro: RESTORED is the chat the user was on but its boot resume is empty
// (modeled here as a genuinely-empty session — the resume returns []), BUSY
// is more-recently-active (sessions[0]). Switch to RESTORED so its id is
// written to localStorage, reload, and assert boot lands BACK on RESTORED —
// never on BUSY.
