        //   - Field bug: opening Sidekick while a podcast streamed over
        //     Bluetooth A2DP (Meta glasses) dropped the BT route to the
        //     mono call codec (HFP/SCO) and degraded the podcast — even
        //     though the user never started a call/dictate/listen. Cause:
        //     a record-capable category (.playAndRecord) forces BT to HFP
        //     for the mic path the instant the session activates, and
        //     .allowBluetoothA2DP only grants A2DP for OUTPUT — it does not
        //     keep A2DP when the category itself is record-capable.
        //   - .playback is output-only and A2DP-friendly, so launching in
        //     it leaves the user's podcast on the high-quality stereo route.
        //     The silent keepalive engine is output-only too, so it runs
        //     fine under .playback (no input tap involved).
        //   - When the user ACTUALLY starts an audio experience (call /
        //     dictate / listen) the JS layer calls into AudioSessionPlugin
        //     (beginCapture) which flips the category to .playAndRecord
        //     just-in-time, then back to .playback on endCapture. First mic
        //     tap after launch pays a one-time category switch + A2DP→HFP
        //     flip (a fraction of a second) — an accepted tradeoff.
        //   - .default mode (NOT .voiceChat): .voiceChat killed TTS reply
        //     playback after the first call (HFP routing / output de-prio
        //     conflicts with WebKit's HTMLAudioElement path). .default is
        //     reliable for both record + playback.
        //   - .allowBluetooth + .allowBluetoothA2DP: kept on the desired
        //     category so the .playAndRecord flip still routes through
        //     paired headsets (AirPods, Shokz, glasses) when capturing.
        //   - .defaultToSpeaker: with no headset attached, output goes to
        //     the loudspeaker rather than the earpiece during capture.
        //   - .mixWithOthers: don't kill other apps' audio (Spotify,
        //     podcast app, navigation). Sidekick coexists.
