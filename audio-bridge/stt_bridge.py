STT bridge: incoming RTC audio track -> 16 kHz mono int16 PCM -> STTProvider
-> data-channel transcript envelopes.

Per peer:

    pc.ontrack(track)
        |
        +- async pump task
            - frame = await track.recv()           # 48 kHz Opus-decoded
            - resampled = resampler(frame)         # 16 kHz mono int16
            - put(pcm_bytes) onto pcm_queue
        |
        +- async stt task
            - get pcm_bytes off pcm_queue
            - feed STTProvider.stream(pcm_iter)
            - on every Transcript:
                send {type: 'transcript', role: 'user', text, is_final}
                over the peer's data channel.  Pass-through only — no
                buffering, no commit-phrase, no silence timer.  The PWA
                owns all UX logic (utterance buffer, silence timeout,
                commit-phrase, dispatch decision).

    Half-duplex echo guard:

        While TTS is active on this peer's outbound track, mic frames
        are substituted with silence before being handed to Deepgram.
        Stops the speaker→mic bleed of our own TTS from polluting the
        user's transcript without disconnecting the WSS or starving
        Deepgram of paced audio. Pure silence-substitution — barge
        detection is owned entirely by the PWA's client-side
        BargeWindow (since v0.381+), which now ships `{type:'barge'}`
        envelopes upstream over the data channel.

Dispatch path:

    The PWA decides when to send an utterance to the agent and posts a
    {type: 'dispatch', text} envelope back over the data channel.  The
    bridge's dispatch_listener (in dispatch_listener.py) handles those
    messages and calls _dispatch_to_agent() here, which POSTs to
    ``<proxy_url>/api/<backend>/responses`` and streams the SSE reply
    back over the data channel as assistant transcript envelopes.

    Bridge → proxy → agent: the bridge does NOT POST directly to the
    agent backend.  The sidekick proxy is the sole sidekick→agent
    gateway.  proxy_url is stashed on the PeerSession at offer time.
